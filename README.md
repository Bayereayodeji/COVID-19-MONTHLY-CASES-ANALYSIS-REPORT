# COVID-19-MONTHLY-CASES-ANALYSIS-REPORT
a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 case data using Microsoft Power BI

As part of my ongoing data analytics training with Vephla University’s Data School, I undertook a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 case data using Microsoft Power BI. Drawing on a dataset sourced from Kaggle.com, the goal of this analysis was to identify critical patterns in COVID-19 cases both globally and specifically within Nigeria.
Key Findings:

1.	Global Statistics:
   
o	Total Confirmed Cases: 14 million

o	Total Death Cases: 674,000

o	New Cases in the Reporting Period: 1 million

3.	Nigeria-Specific Statistics:

o	Total Confirmed Cases: 2,000

o	Total Death Cases: 2

o	New Cases in the Reporting Period: 238

4.	Monthly Trends:

o	Month with Highest Death Cases: March, with a total of 353 recorded deaths.

o	Month with Highest New Cases: March, with 162 new cases, accounting for 69.83% of the monthly increase.

Recommendations: 

Given the insights derived from this analysis, the following recommendations are proposed to guide further response measures:
1.	Enhanced Surveillance in High-Risk Months: The data indicates a significant spike in both new and death cases in March, suggesting seasonal or situational factors that may heighten transmission. Increased health surveillance and preparedness efforts should be concentrated around these high-risk periods.
2.	Focused Public Health Campaigns in Vulnerable Regions: While Nigeria’s COVID-19 death count is relatively low, the emergence of new cases indicates ongoing risks. Public health initiatives, such as vaccination drives and information campaigns, should be prioritized in areas with rising case counts to curb further spread.
3.	Data-Driven Resource Allocation: With global cases at 14 million, resource allocation to manage and prevent COVID-19 should be continually guided by data analytics, ensuring that response efforts are targeted effectively in regions and periods of greatest need.

Report Summary: 

This analysis underscores the value of data analytics in understanding and responding to global health crises. By identifying critical trends and making informed recommendations, we can better prepare for, and potentially mitigate, future outbreaks.
